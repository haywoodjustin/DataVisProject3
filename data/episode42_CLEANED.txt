Morty: Come on Rick, w-we're almost there.
Rick: Leave me Morty. It's the only way.
Rick:  Wha-were-were we Blades in that one? That's fucking tight.
Morty: Just stay with me.
Rick:  I'm scared, Morty. I can see the end. I'm a silly man. I'm a small, silly man.
Rick: I'm sorry I got you into this.
Morty:  Then how about I get us out of this?
Jessica: Hello?
Morty: I-It's Morty. From school.
Jessica: Oh hey, Morty. What's up?
Morty: Um, I just want to say that you're really great and I'm sorry that the timing never really worked out with us, but you're really great and I wish I got to know you better.
Jessica: Oh, I mean, that's a lot.
Morty: Oh, uh, yeah, sorry, I guess I just...
Jessica: No, I just wish you'd said it sooner.
Morty: Wh-What?
Jessica: Yeah, I mean being nervous is sort of selfish sometimes, you know?
Ship alarm: Life support systems failing.
Morty: Yeah, that's a great point.
Jessica: Well, what are you doing tonight?
Morty: Tonight?
Jessica: Yeah, do you, like, want to watch a movie or something?
Morty: Um, yeah, tonight. Sounds great.  Holy shit! Holy shit! Come on, come on!
Rick: Ugh, where are we?
Morty: We're home, Rick. I landed us in the ocean.
Rick: The ocean? The ocean on Earth?!
Morty: Uh, yeah, I guess so.
Rick: Oh, shit. Holy shit. We have to go. We have to go right fucking now!
Morty: What?
Rick: You touched the ocean, Morty. Oh fuck! Shit!
Mr. Nimbus: Richard! You have desecrated the sacred treaty betwixt land and sea! Now face the wrath of your once and eternal foe... Mr. Nimbus!
Morty: Sorry, who is that?
Rick: My... nemesis.
Morty: What?
Rick: My fucking nemesis, okay?!
Morty: Okay, but what was his name again?
Mr. Nimbus: I am Mr. Nimbus!
Rick: He's gonna say that a lot.
