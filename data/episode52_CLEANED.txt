Rick: Ugh, guess this is how it ends. I thought I was better than this. Dramatic voiceover while stranded in space? I-I guess when you're dying, the first thing to go is your creativity. Citadel's gone, and-and the saucer we escaped in is out of power.
Alternate Morty: Oh man, I'm so scared in here …
Rick: The extra Mortys went feral—
Alternate Morty: Gahhhh!
Rick:  —eh, some problems solve themselves. Been drinking a lot—Morty, I told you to write this down! I-I don't have a helmet like that Avengers guy did!—been drinking a lot of my piss. Portal gun's still broken—
Morty:  Guess that was all part of Evil Morty's plan.
Rick: Evil Morty? Can we stop flattering this guy? His plan was to monologue and fuck off! He basically threw a tantrum to announce he was quitting Twitter!
Morty: Nobody quits Twitter.  Hey, remember, like a second ago, when you pretended to not know who Iron Man was? Who was that for?
Rick: Shh, shh, shush, Morty. This is how we go. Bear it with grace.  Spinal cord, Robitussin as a base, then surprise me. 
Morty: Mom!
Rick: Beth, maybe!
Rick: Is she trying to say something?  We-we can't hear you! How dumb are … Beth, you're in a vacuum, sound travels on air!  Why am I yelling?
Space Beth:  IS THIS A PRIVATE PARTY? OR CAN ANYONE JOIN?
Morty:  Wow. Great.
Rick:  Yeah, that's … Wow. Really worth it. That was not worth it! It's corny!  You! Corn! Dying of starvation here!
Space Beth: WHEN I DECIDED TO SAY IT, I DIDN'T KNOW IT WOULD BE …
Morty: Oh my God, stop explaining!  Stop explaining!
Space Beth: … SUBJECTED TO THIS SCRUTINY.
Rick: Are you finished?  She's not finished.
Space Beth: MAYBE I WON'T RESCUE YOU.
Rick: Oh, real mature.
Morty: Oh, nice.
Rick: Real classy.
Rick:  It was a good line, honey.
Space Beth:  I didn't need it to be. I don't care what you think.
Home Beth:  Oh my god, she found you. Here, eat. Eat.
Morty: Oh hell yes!
Rick: Hold on, buddy. Our systems could go into shock from solid food.  Digestibot, convert to nutrient mass.
Rick: I'm just gonna risk it.
Home Beth: Since when do you guys get stranded?  Thank you, by the way.
Space Beth: Almost left them out there.
Rick: Portal travel's broken.  Mmm. Are these heirloom tomatoes? Digestibot, try these.
Digestibot: Yum. Yum.
Home Beth: So you can't hop realities anymore? Does that mean you'll finally have to wash your robe?
Rick: Good point. They need to reboot the Portal Index immediately.
Rick: Basically just a hard reset on the fluid. Hold tight, the Earth's gonna shake a bit.
Space Beth: Uhh …
Home Beth: Oh!
Rick:  Oh, shit.
Morty:  Wait, what? What's happening?
Rick: Instead of resetting portal travel, I may have reset portal travellers. Too late to apologise.
Jerry: Rick, why am I pulsing green? And don't say you don't know, because you're pulsing green.
Morty:  Rick, are we about to die?
Rick:  No, we're about to vanish from this reality.
Jerry: That's totally dying!
Rick: No it isn't! It's everyone from this reality returning to their reality of origin.
Morty: Back to our original universes!
Rick: I explained it fine, Morty. You're spoonfeeding spoons. Where is Summer?
Summer: Oh nice, you guys are back.  Whoa.
Rick:  Summer, three of us are one-way blind-hopping. You gotta help us get back. There's a protocol for this in your chores server, filename 'booger-aids'.
Summer: Every file is 'booger-aids'!
Rick: I—I hate naming things! Just search for words like 'one-way blind-hop, reset map beacon'.
Jerry:  Why do I have a reality of origin?
Rick: There's no time to explain, Jerry. Counting on you, Summer! One-way blind-hop beacon protocol.  Here we gooooo!
Jerry: So there was time to explain.
Rick: Don't waste extra precious seconds with your pettiness, Jerry!  Summer, let's run down—
Summer: One-way blind-hop reset beacon, 'booger-aids'.
Rick:  Cool.  Wow.
Jerry:  There was so much time to explain!
Rick: Yes, fine! Hindsight is 20-20. Who has ever taken this long to vanish?
Jerry: How did I end up not in my own universe?  Oh, my god. The Jerryboree.
Rick and Morty:  Oh, the Jerryboree!
Rick:  Deep cut.
Home Beth: Wait, but where's our real dad and our real Morty?
Summer:  Buried in the backyard. 
Home Beth: That's what the possums are after.
Space Beth: Dad's got you in the family business too, huh?
Summer: Yeah, Morty's an easy mark, but Rick pays me in things like …
Summer:  Wolverine claws.
Space Beth: Well, looks like you got this. See you guys in another—two years? 
Summer: Or you could stick around for this one? Looks like it involves Grandpa's grotty citadel.  We could, you know, break things, loot stuff.
Space Beth:  I should … probably get back to … saving the galaxy.
Summer: Please?
Space Beth:  Guess I could loot some stuff. Fine. Yeah. Okay. Let's make it quick.
Home Beth:  Awesome, I've never been. Let's do this. Okay. Adventure family. Woo! 
Summer: Uhh … Okay!
Rick: Fuck.
Rick Prime:  Excuse me? Bro, Ricks don't pass on this.
Voice: Rick, is that you?
Rick:  Yeah, Diane.
Diane: You've been gone so long.  Did you find our daughter's killer?
Rick: Not yet, sorry. Still looking. 
Diane: You'll find him. You always do everything you set your mind to, except keep your family alive. But that was hardly your fault.
Rick:  Mute.
Diane:  If I could be muted, I wouldn't be too-too-too good at haunting you, would I, you dirty bear?
Rick: Yeah. I forgot I wanted to be haunted. 
Diane: I guess you predicted you might. That's where haunting comes in handy, huh?
Rick: Very good point, sugar.
Morty: Rick?
Morty: Hello? Original family? Sorry about last time. Rick, he was in space prison. We couldn't just—hello?
Morty: Aaaah!
Morty:  Aw, geez.
Morty: Ah!
Morty:  Oh!
Original Jerry: Agh! Ah, fuck! Dammit Morty, there's no doctors anymore.
Morty:  Dad!?
Home Beth: Figures it's underwhelming, the one time I visit.
Summer: Yeah, sorry, usually, there's cowboy Rick and Mortys and stuff.
Home Beth: Looks like they could use a couple repairmen Ricks and Mortys, right?
Summer: Oh, tight! Little scavenger dudes. If they shoot at us, I'm allowed to …
Summer:  do this.  Shit, yeah.
Summer: Space Mom, get in on this!
Summer: Cool Mom.
Space Beth: Let's keep it moving. I don't have all day.
Home Beth: I got it! I got it.  Sorry!  Sorry!  I got it. Sorry!
Home Beth:  I was … gonna do it …
Summer:  Ugh, terrestrials, am I right?
Diane: I kept up the search in your absence. You want a new list of potential locations?
Rick: You're always just one room away, huh? 
Diane: Yeah. Remember, if you thought you could see or touch me, it might give you a level of  com-com-comfort.
Rick: Right, can't have that. Come on, Summer. 
Diane: Who's Summer? Should I be jealous? I hope  Summer knows what happens to the people you love!
Old Man: Hey, Rick!
Rick: Hey, Mr Goldmanbachmajorian. S-still alive, huh? What's up?
Mr. GBM: I was hoping you could help me make sense of a note I found this morning? It's written by someone claiming to be me. They say my mind is 'held captive in a time loop, trapped in the day of a traumatic event by the agony of a formidable intelligence, but also that my captor forgot about aging, that my body spoils and yearns for death while my soul remains stuck in place, caught like a fly in amber.'
Rick:  Right. I used to drink drink.  Uhh … no clue pal.
Mr. GBM: That's okay. I found other notes in the trash just like it. Poor weirdo. I pity them. Wish they could let go and move on.
Rick: Sounds healthy.
Mr. GBM: Sure would be!
Mr. GBM: Aaah, sweet death!
Diane: Was that symbolic? Are you letting go? I understand, baby. I forgive you!
Rick:  You don't get to say that, you're not her! You're a thing I built to torture myself.  This whole fucking timeline is cursed. I gotta get out of here.
Diane: Because you want to move on.
Rick: Because I don't! And  I have to. I came back on accident. The guy I'm looking for, he's... he's not findable, Diane.  I live with a version of Beth now.
Diane: Sounds like a version of nice.
Rick: We have grandkids. That's who Summer is. She's going to get me out of here.  She reminds me of you.
Diane: Oh really? Is she dead too?
Rick:  Bye, Diane.
Diane: You're not honestly going to fly into that rift without coordinates, are you? Don't give up on us, Rick. I don't make the rules. Haunters gonna haunt.
Diane: Baby, are you killing yourself?
Rick: I'm more embracing the win-win of risking my life.
Morty: Where's Mom and Summer?
Original Jerry: Oh, they're gone. Sorry, Morty.
Morty: Gone gone?
Original Jerry: We spent a long time in that ice. A gentle mutant licked us out, but Beth got sick and Summer... didn't thaw right.
Original Jerry: With no one left to blame, I finally had to deal with myself. Buried my grief at Barnes & Noble. "Four Agreements", "Eat Pray Love", Frank Miller's "The Dark Knight Returns". Learned to accept things for what they are.
Original Jerry: In a few of these, the whole brain is still intact. Makes you wonder if some people were still in there,  just trapped in the horror. Anyway, it's awesome protein.
Morty: I'm so sorry, Dad. But my real, original Dad beat the apocalypse. I-I-I guess we all underestimated you. Hey, w-what's that game we always try to play as a family, y—the one we never finished?
Original Jerry: Downbeat.
Morty: Yes! Let's play Downbeat. I-I bet I can find it! We can finish now!
Original Jerry: Yeah, you should totally do that.
Morty: Hey, yeah, cool, I-I got it! We'll play Downbeat and we'll-we'll camp here tonight and then rebuild the house.  You know, we got food, fresh water, and we've got family.
Morty: The fuck? 
Original Jerry:  Morty. I wrote this note in advance in case you're wondering how I left so fast. My plan is to wait for you to turn your back, them I'm going to grab all your shit and split. Depending on how long you were out of the room, you'll probably be thinking I can't be that far away and you'll want to foll—
Original Jerry:  Morty, wrote this fast 'cause had to set trap. Thought you'd have cooler shit. See other note. Bye.
Morty: Motherfu— 
Morty:  Whoa, whoa! Slow down! Slow down!
Morty: Not cool! Oh!
Morty: What the hell, Dad?
Original Jerry: Don't take it personal, Morty. That's one of the Four Agreements. I don't remember the other three, but I know Commissioner Gordon was cool with Batman moving on.
Morty: Batman doesn't abandon people!
Original Jerry: You abandoned us.
Morty: I deserve that. But, you know, it... it improved you.
Original Jerry: Oh, am I cool enough for you now? Well, that was easy, it only cost me fucking everything!
Morty: Whoa, hey, I-I—
Original Jerry: You came back and talked about us like we weren't people, Morty! Then you bailed and left us to freeze!
Morty: I-I was apologizing for that earlier—
Original Jerry: Your mom and sister died, Morty!  And I moved on. From caring. And that is the best deal you will ever get. So take it.
Morty: Please don't go! I-if Rick comes back, we ca-we can find you a new reality. A new Mom, a new Summer, a... job!
Original Jerry: Oh, you don't get it, kid. Except for this conversation, my life is perfect. Rick was always right.  Everyone needs to let go.
Morty: Aww, you came back. I guess we really did form a bond.
Morty: Ow! Hey, stop it! Get away from me!  No! Help!
Summer: Alright, pin dropped, Grandpa!
Summer: Come and get us.
Rick: Come on, come on, come on!
Diane: Baby? Something to keep in mind—if you were pulled home by whatever happened, it's likely our target was, as well. It's also likely he's having as much trouble leaving as you are.
Rick: He's trapped.
Summer: Grandpa!
Rick: Oh, fuck yes!
Summer: Grandpa—Grandpa?
Rick: Summer! Gold star, always believed in you. N-now the hard part.
Summer: Hard part?
Rick: Way worse things than me can see that beacon, too. Hunker down and protect it while I grab Morty. Rick out! Try to survive!
Summer: Oh, shit.  Domestic Mom should hide, maybe?
Home Beth: "Domestic Mom?"
Summer: I mean, she's the cool space one.
Space Beth: Look, I'm not looking to get caught in whatever this is. You guys can both hide maybe, hash it out.
Home Beth: Oh, quit talking down. I'm you with the patience to do laundry.
Summer: Mom, stop being jealous of our bond!
Home Beth: She ran from our choices. I have to parent them.
Space Beth: It's not like I didn't care. That's what the clone was for. Aah!
Summer: Moms!
Rick: Morty!
Morty: Rick? I knew it! I knew you wouldn't leave me!
Morty: Ow! The fuck?
Rick: Morty, did you see another Rick here? Nondescript haircut, sci-fi jacket?  Eh, of course you didn't see him, you'd be dead. Or you'd be a bomb. Do you feel bomby? Nah, you woulda blown up by now.
Morty: Wasn't the Rick here dead? Th-th-that's why you pick places, right?
Rick: Uh, well, your Rick, uh, yeah, not dead, more like, not around. When I met you, I was sorta hoping he might turn up one day— You son of a bitch! I got you!
Morty: W-w-where are we going?
Rick: To kill your grandpa, little buddy.
Morty: Wait, what?
Morty: I don't understand. My original Rick killed your family? And you were just waiting for him to come back?
Rick: Seems like you understand fine, Morty. That was A+ re-piping.  We're here.
Rick: This guy, Morty, he hates being found but loves building elaborate shit. Like-like-like playing a ton of Minecraft but all on a private server.
Morty: Am I in a fucking K-hole right now? What is going on?
Rick Prime:  Whoa-ho-ho, you found me!
Rick Prime: I shoot the first monitor, too. Listen, I'm not here. Or am I?
Rick Prime: There's the clone you found! Or maybe it's me, all naked! Just a lil' Keyser Soze. I mean, why would I admit it's not?
Rick Prime: Oh-hoho, yeah! Look at him! Look at him go! Look at him dance! O-or me. Again, it might be me, like a "Saw" thing. I'm very sneaky. Here's a bunch of killbots to deal with while ya wrestle with that.
Rick Prime: Obviously, I don't know who I'm talking to here.
Rick Prime: It's all prerecorded.
Rick Prime: But if you got this far, you probably think you're real special. Tell you what...
Rick Prime: Oop! There he goes! Maybe that actually was me! If you follow him down there, we can do a big fight. Fifty percent chance I'm not lying.
Space Beth:  We're in trouble, asshole! I shouldn't have to beg.
Morty: Wait, my moms are in trouble?
Rick: Those versions of them are.
Morty: W-we gotta save them! Rick, this is an obvious trap. If you go down there he's just gonna kill you.
Rick: Good!
Morty: What? 
Rick: Now what?
Morty: If you don't care if you die, why do you care if I die?
Rick: Knock it off! Get out of here! You did this last season! You're like a suicide bomber!
Morty: Takes one to know one.
Rick: Yeah, well, you get it from him, not me.
Morty: I don't know him. You're my grandpa, Rick. Rick and Morty. A hundred years.
Rick Prime: This place totally might go up, by the way. Here's a bunch of countdowns. One of them's probably accurate.
Space Beth: Ah, fucking stupid 5th-dimensional stomach juices.
Home Beth: Sorry for the sitcom fight, and maybe getting us digested.
Space Beth: You've got incredible timing.
Home Beth: Oh, don't be a bitch. I'm parenting. Makes sense you don't recognize it. You've been out of practice for a while.
Space Beth: Good! I'm glad that they have you! I don't want to be "Space Mom."
Home Beth: You've made that clear. Just don't let Summer mistake your rejection of her for good taste.
Space Beth: I'm not trying to. It's all her!
Summer: Jesus! It'd be cool if you were around more. I don't wanna get married. I'm 17. My affection is the wind. Don't try to compete for it.  I could hear every word of that through the helmets. Thank fuck I only had to kill most of them.
Home Beth: Jesus, that ship really has sailed.
Space Beast: And now... we feast!
Rick: This emergency was oversold to me.
Summer: Grandpa!
Home Beth & Space Beth: Morty!
Morty: Moms!
Morty: Wait, i-if they had to wear helmets—
Rick: I do childproofing stuff while you're asleep.
Morty: Why don't you childproof Dad?
Home Beth: Ah, great reminder.
Rick: Wait!
Home Beth: Time to get Jerry.
Rick: Ugh.
Alternate Beth: Maybe I wouldn't be so uptight if I wasn't married to an unemployed receptacle of human fear!
Alternate Summer: Get a job, Dad, it's been a decade.
Alternate Rick: Whoof. Pretty brutal, Jer. I-I know a good alligator park if you wanna kill yourself.
Alternate Morty: I got expelled today.
Alternate Beth: What the hell, Morty?!
Alternate Rick: Oh, no, you got expelled. Whoa, what a horrible thing.
Alternate Beth: You are so fucking dumb!
Alternate Rick: Too bad, Morty.
Home Beth: Hi, hon.
Rick: Whoof, some real Season 2 vibes in there, you know what I'm sayin'?
Jerry:  You know, never thought I'd say this, but I think I'm glad we spent that time divorced.
Jerry: Eh, one second.
Alternate Rick: I'll build a fucking swing set in the backyard!
Alternate Beth: What the hell Morty?
Jerry: You know, I may technically be from here. But I'm a goddamn interdimensional traveller now, and all of you——can kiss my sci-fi ass.
Home Beth: It gets me every time.
Morty: Wow, what an amazing joke I just told. A-and also, what an adventure. You know, I guess it doesn't matter where we're from if we're together, huh? Good-good final moral thing.
Summer: This is everyone's original dimension now.
Rick: Great wrap-ups, kids.
Season 2 Jerry: Ugh, you're back.
Rick: Oh shit, Season 2 Jerry!
Season 2 Jerry: Look, before you bust my balls, can someone help with the shower? It's colder than Beth on her anniversary. Also...  Look what I found in Rick's room!
Mr. Frundles: Mmm, I'm Mr. Frundles!
Season 2 Jerry: I don't care how cute he is, we agreed! No Boogens in the house! 
Rick: Wait, Season 2 Jerry! Don't!
Mr. Frundles: Nyaah! 
Morty: Oh!
Summer: Mr. Frundles!
Rick: Everybody in the car.
Mr. Frundles : Mmm, I'm Mr. Frundles!
Jerry: Wait, but I thought he was Mr. Frundles. 
Rick: Everybody in the car! Now!
Many species of Mr. Frundles:  Mmm, I'm Mr. Frundles!
Beth: What the fuck Dad?! Why would you bring that thing into our house?
Rick: It was cute! Fuck we gotta find a new timeline now! You know how hard that shit is without portals? We gotta do the thing with the Rift and the beacon again! The whole fucking episode all over again! Car, fabricate some vomit bags.
Space Beth: Can't we just go back and fix it?
Mr. Frundles : Mmm, I'm Mr. Frundles!
Summer: I can't believe portal travel's broken.
Rick: I'll get to it when I get to it.
Morty: Lift with your knees, Mom.
Home Beth: How many times have you done this?
Jerry:  Oh, God.
Home Beth: And you swear they die of natural causes?
Rick: Mm-hmm, yep.
Space Beth: The exact same as our old timeline? Even my stuff?
Rick: Bit of a rush job, actually, so they do say "parmesan" weird.
Morty: How do they say—
Rick: Par-mees-ian.
Summer: Boo.
Jerry: Jesus Christ.
Rick: I could've left you guys! You think the concept of family matters to me? I'm not even your Rick!
Summer: Uh-huh.
Jerry: "I'm Denial Rick!"
Home Beth: See you inside, Dad.
Home Beth: Sorry I was such a Dance Mom about Summer. She's your daughter too.
Space Beth: No, boundaries are good. But, uh, speaking of, maybe I've put up too many. Is it okay if I come around sometimes?
Home Beth: That could be nice.
Space Beth: That's a cute outfit.
Home Beth: The one we always wear?
Rick:  Yes, Morty?
Morty: You promise I'm not, you know, bait? T-to make that Rick come back?
Rick: What? M-Morty, for you to be bait, the guy'd have to value something. He truly does not give a shit.  He's the real deal.
Morty: Parmeee...san...
Rick: Par-meee-sian. Par-meee-sian.
Morty: Par...par-meee-sian.
Rick: Par-me-sian.
Morty: Gross.
Rick: Yeah.
Morty: I hate it.
Original Jerry: Hello? Morty? That one big Rat?
Rick Prime: Whoa, this is a development.
Original Jerry: Gah!
Rick Prime: Shh. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, lil guy. Easy. You're a Jerry, right? Never got too close to the concept. Boy, you have really arc'd out.
Original Jerry: Were you putting on pants?
Rick Prime: What? Oh, yeah, no, I was naked to fuck with a guy. Speaking of, did you talk to me, or a little kid around here?
Original Jerry: Maybe. Why? Because if you hate them, too... I could be down for a little team up.
Rick Prime: Eh, I really don't "team up" anymore. Managing people, such a headache. Aah!
Original Jerry: Fatality. Jerry wins!
Rick Prime: Oh goddamn dude! Badass!
Original Jerry: Why are you here?
Rick Prime: Buddy, I have been asking myself that exact same question.
