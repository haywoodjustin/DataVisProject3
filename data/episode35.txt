Morty: Rick, we did it! W-we got it!
Rick: Hurry up, Morty get in!
(Morty gets in. Chachi's about to get in before he is shot in the head, spewing blood over Morty.)
Morty: Chachi!
Rick: Fuck Chachi, Morty! Did you get it?
(Rick shoves Chachi's body and closes the door)
Morty: He helped me escape prison!
Rick: Did you get the Ultimate Cube?
(Morty takes a glowing cube out of his backpack and hands it to Rick.)
Rick: Oh, it's purple.
Morty: You said it was purple.
Rick: I said mine was, I didn't know they all were.
(Rick throws it in the back.)
Rick: And now we do, thanks to Chichi.
Morty: Chachi!
(The scene cuts to them in their ship while in space.)
Morty: So, uh...w-w-when do I get it?
Rick: Get what, a hug? Let's find a planet with a garden hose first?
Morty: A dragon!
Rick: A dragon?
Morty: You asked me to cut class and fight robots with, I said no, you said millions of lives depend on it, I said I'll do it for a dragon, you said whatever, I want my dragon!
Rick: You know who's into dragons, Morty? Nerds that refuse to admit they're Christian.
Morty: I want my dragon!
Rick: Let me get you rocket shoes, l-let me get you Wolverine claws, let me get you a fucking rocket hat! Just make sure to use it with rocket shoes or it'll rip your head off.
Morty: I want my dragon, I want my dragon, I want my dragonâ€”!
(Rick sprays with a gas, knocking him out. He laughs before the gas engulfs the inside of the ship.)
Rick: Oh crap. {coughs} Crap!
Beth: Dad, are you okay? Your ship crashed in Balta.
Rick: {grunts} I'm okay.
Beth: Oh, thank god.
(Pause.)
Beth: Dad, did you promise Morty a dragon?
Rick: AAAAAAARGH!
