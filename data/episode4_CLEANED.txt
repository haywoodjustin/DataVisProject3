Rick: T-t-t-this is just sloppy craftsmanship.
Morty: Hey, Rick. Boy, sure is really especially beautiful out there today, huh?
Rick: Oh, yes, Morty. It's almost unbelievable, isn't it?
Morty: Yeah, you know? There's something about the air. And just the way the sunshine is.
Rick: Oh, sure, buddy. Yeah. Sure. B-brilliant. Very convincing.
Morty: Wh… convincing?
Rick: Oh! Responsive, too! In real time! I love it!
Morty: Uhhokay.
Morty: What's with Mom?
Morty: Okay, you know what, Rick? You're acting weird, too.
Rick: Whatever, quote-unquote “Morty.”
Morty: Alright, well I'll see you after school.  Ow! Oof! Ugh! Damn it! I'm all right. I'm okay.
Mr. Goldenfold: Alright, who can tell me what 5 x 9 is?  Morty?
Morty: Uh, me?
Mr. Goldenfold: What is 5 x 9?
Morty: Um, you know, it's, uh, at least 40.
Mr. Goldenfold: Morty, that's exactly correct! 5 x 9 is at least 40! Come up here.
Jessica: Whoo! Way to go, Morty!
Morty: W-w-w-what do you want me to teach you?
Student: Ooh, ooh! How do you make concentrated dark matter?
Mr. Goldenfold: Oh, that's a good question.
Morty: Concentrated huh?
Mr. Goldenfold: Concentrated dark matter. The fuel for accelerated space travel. Now, do you know how to make it?
Morty: Uhhh…
Jessica: Come on, Morty. Isn't your grandpa, like, a scientist?
Morty: Oh, yeah, but, you know, he told me that I shouldn't go around spouting off about, you know, his science and stuff.
Jessica: I bet you've seen him make concentrated dark matter a lot. You know, if you tell us, I’ll be your girlfriend.
Morty: Uh, y-you will?
Mr. Goldenfold: Seems like a rare opportunity, Morty.
Mr. Goldenfold: Stop right there! If he leaves, I'm giving him an F!
Rick: He doesn't care.
Rick: Take a shower with me, Morty.
Morty: What?!
Rick: Morty, that's not class. T-t-t-that wasn't your teacher. This isn't your school. This entire world is not the world. We're inside a huge simulation chamber on an alien spaceship.
Morty: Wait a minute. W-what are you talking about?
Rick: Zigerion scammers, Morty. The galaxy's most ambitious, least successful con artists. You know, it's lucky for us they're also really uncomfortable with nudity.
Morty: Aw, come on, Rick. If everyone’s just gonna be insane today, at least let me be insane with Jessica.
Rick: I can’t let you do that, Morty.
Morty: Give it to me!
Rick: No! You give it to me!
Morty: G-g-give it!
Rick: Morty, come on! Morty!
Morty: No, Rick!
Zigerion 1: Oh, god, sir! They're still naked! Ugh.
Prince Nebulon: Well, check every five quintons and tell me when they're not!
Zigerion 1: I think we should make Kevin look, sir.
Kevin: What?! No! W-w-why would you even say that?
Stu: Uh, sir, we have a situation over here.
Prince Nebulon: If there's a wiener on that monitor, I swear to god, Stu.
Stu: Something is drawing a lot of processing power. Oh, wait. No wonder.  There's another real human in the simulator.
Prince Nebulon: How did this happen?! Where's the Abductions Department?
Zigerion 2: Hey, man, Abductions just follows the acquisition order.
Zigerion 3: Don't put this on Acquisitions! We only acquire humans that haven't been simulated!
Kevin: Well, Simulations doesn't simulate anybody that's been abducted, so—
Stu: Rick's son-in-law, Jerry Smith. So far, he hasn't noticed he's in a simulation.
Radio: This is earth radio. And now, here's…human music.
Morty: Rick!
Rick: Uhp, uhp, uhp! Morty, keep your hands off your ding-dong! It's the only way we can speak freely. Look around you, Morty. Do you really think this world is real? You'd have to be an idiot not to notice all the sloppy details. Look, that guy's putting a bun between two hot dogs.
Morty: I don't know, Rick. I mean, I’ve seen people do that before.
Rick: Well, look at that old lady. She's, she's walking a cat on a leash.
Morty: Uh, Mrs. Spencer does that all the time, Rick.
Rick: Look, I-I-I don't wanna hear about Mrs. Spencer, Morty! She's an idiot! Alright, alright, there. W-what about that, Morty?
Morty: Okay, okay, you got me on that one.
Rick: Oh, really, Morty? Are you sure you haven't seen that somewhere in real life before?
Morty: No, no. I haven't seen that. I mean, why would a Poptart wanna live inside a toaster, Rick? I mean, that would be, like, the scariest place for them to live. You know what I mean?
Rick: You're missing the point, Morty. Why would he drive a smaller toaster with wheels? I mean, does your car look like a smaller version of your house? No.
Morty: So, why are they doing this? W-what do they want? 
Rick: Well, that would be obvious to you, Morty, if you'd been paying attention.
Paramedic: We got the president of the United States in here! We need 10cc of concentrated dark matter, stat, or he'll die!
Morty: Concentrated dark matter! They were asking about that in class.
Rick: Yeah, it's a special fuel I invented to travel through space faster than anybody else. These Zigerions are always trying to scam me out of my secrets, but they made a big mistake this time, Morty. They dragged you into this. Now they're gonna pay!
Morty: Wait, wha, w-w-what are we gonna do?
Rick: We'll scam the scammers, Morty. And we're gonna take them for everything they've got.
Jerry: National Apple Farmers of America…
Mr. Marklevitz: Yes.
Jerry: You do?
All: Yes.
Jerry: So I sold it? I sold the idea?
All: Yes.
Jerry: Oh my god! Thank you!
Jerry: Hey! I just sold my first pitch!
Old man: Slow down!
Woman: Lookin' good.
Mailman: My man!
Jerry: Guess who just sold the apples campaign.
Simulation Beth: Who just sold the apples campaign?
Jerry: Me! I guess it wasn't a rip-off of "got milk?" after all. Guess someone was wrong.
Simulation Beth: Yes.
Jerry: Well, all is forgiven, because right now, I’ve got an erection the size of an East Coast lighthouse, and I’m coming home to share it with my beautiful wife.
Simulation Beth: Okay.
Jerry: Wait, really?
Simulation Beth: Yes.
Woman: Lookin' good.
Old man: Slow down!
Morty: Aw, geez, Rick. I-I don't know if I like this plan,you know? I mean, crowds, t-t-t-they have a tendency to make me really nervous.
Rick: Morty, relax. It's just a bunch of 1s and 0s out there. You're gonna be fine.  Just follow my lead.  Yo, deejay, drop that beat.
Rick: Uh-oh, Morty. This crowd looks too small for one of our famous rap concerts. I don't think we can perform our new song, "The Recipe for Concentrated Dark Matter," for a crowd this tiny.
Morty: You got that right, Rick.
Rick: Now that’s more like it! Morty, here we go. Let me hear everybody say "hey-oh!" yeah!  All the ladies say, "yeah!"  Everybody over thirty, do this with your hands! Everybody with a red shirt, jump up and down! 
Rick: Yo, everyone whose first name begins with an "L" who isn't Hispanic, walk in a circle the same number of times as the square root of your age times ten!  Run, Morty! Before the system reboots!
Jerry: Yeah! You like that? Now who's unremarkable? You hungry for apples? Are you hungry for apples?!
Jerry: Oh, my god. That's the best sex I've ever had in my life. It's… it's too good. I don't deserve this, Beth. I'm a fraud.
Morty: Oh, man, Rick! W-w-w-where we running to?
Morty: Holy crap!
Rick: Come on, Morty.
Zigerion: Sir, they're over the edge.
Rick: Keep your eyes peeled for the central processing room, Morty. That's how we're gonna scam these idiots.
Morty: So, hey, why do these aliens keep coming after you, Rick, if you're so much smarter than them?
Rick: Don't worry about it, Morty. There's plenty of them, you little goofball.  Come here, Morty! Oh, I gotcha!
Morty: Come on, quit it, Rick! Quit it!
Rick: Nothing wrong with just a little bit of horseplay every now and then, little fella.
Morty: Wow. What do you know? Huh. That was easy.
Rick: Totes malotes, dawg.
Morty: Just kind of hard to believe, you know?
Rick: Believe it, Morty. And once again, I'm flying away with everything I can carry, and the Zigerions got nothing of mine.
Jerry: Mr. Marklevitz, do you have a minute to talk?
Jerry: Look, I’m a fraud. I mean, let's face it. "Hungry for apples" is just a rip-off of "Got milk?" It's almost identical.
Jerry: Okay. I deserve that. Um, I guess I'll just pack up my desk.
Jerry: Yeah! Wait. Really?
Jerry: Yes! I mean, it may be derivative, but it's the most successful campaign to come out of this agency in a long time.
Jerry: I-I’m not saying it should win an award for commercials, but it could certainly be nominated for an award for commercials specifically about apples, like an Appley or something.
Jerry: Is there really an award called the Appley for apple-related ad campaigns?
Jerry: Could we nominate me?
Jerry: Holy crap!
Rick: Get in, Morty. I'm gonna be able to use these processors to make some real important science stuff.  Huh. I thought I entered the code right. 
Prince Nebulon: Well, what's this? W-what could this possibly be? Because it looks like you're inside a simulation…inside a simulation. You're still on the ship. Game-day bucket go boom!
Cynthia: Sir, the, uh, doctor's appointment to examine the discoloration on your butthole flaps was—
Prince Nebulon: Too loud, Cynthia. Too loud and too specific.
Rick: Uhh…
Prince Nebulon: We've known how to make concentrated dark matter for a long time. But now we also know the code to your fabled safe, Rick Sanchez! All your most valuable secrets will now be ours!
Rick: Uh, yeah, until I get home before you and change the combination, you bunch of idiots!
Prince Nebulon: That is why you're never getting home. Get them!
Rick: RUN MORTY!
Morty: Oh my god!
Jerry: I got to tell you, this morning, I didn't even know this award existed. Now I'm holding one. And, um… Look, I want to say that today was the best day of my life But the truth is, it's, it's more meaningful than that.
Mailman: My man!
Jerry: Yes. Thank you, sir. I am finally complete!
Mailmen: My my my my man!
Jerry: Aah! What the hell?!  No.
Rick: Jerry?!
Morty: Dad!
Rick: Man up, Jerry! I may need you to work the lasers.
Morty: Oh, man! They're hot on our tail, Rick!
Rick: I guess they really do have concentrated dark matter.
Morty: Well, you know how to make it, too, right, Rick?
Rick: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, check the engine room. We just need cesium, Plutonic quarks, and bottled water.
Morty: Whoa! It's all here, Rick!
Rick: Wow, Morty. Lucky break. Grab that bucket. Okay, two parts Plutonic quarks, one part cesium.
Morty: Okay. Uh-huh. Alright.
Rick: Now empty the water bottle into the bucket and pour it all into the fuel tank so we can get the hell out of here! What are you doing, Morty?! There's no time!
Rick: Oh, no.
Jerry: What the…?
Rick: No!
Rick: You simulated my grandson's genitalia?! Y-y-you bunch of diabolical sons of bitches!
Zigerion 1: Kevin fought real hard to supervise that project.
Kevin: You said you weren't gonna tell anyone! I'm never gonna live this down, am I?
Rick: All right. Okay. All right, great. Wonderful. You win. Can we go home now?
Zigerion 1: I don't know. Can you?
Cynthia: Oh. Uh, sir, should I cancel that appointment, then?
Rick: Hey, Jerry, don't worry about it. So what if the most meaningful day of your life was a simulation operating at minimum capacity?
Jerry: You know what, Rick? Those guys took you for a ride, too. You should try having a little respect for the dummies of the universe, now that you're one of us.
Rick: Maybe you're right, Jerry. Maybe you're right.
Jerry: Whoa! What the hell?! W-what happened back there?
Rick: Why don't you ask the smartest people in the universe, Jerry? Oh, yeah. You can't. They blew up.
Jerry: So… What do you think?
Mr. Marklevitz: You're fired.
Jerry: Wha--? But t-this idea was tested in a state-of-the-art simulation.
Mr. Marklevitz: Well, then, it was a terrible simulation. Get out.
Mr. Marklevitz: Man, how does a guy like that go home and have sex with his wife?
Rick: Hey, Morty.
Morty: What?
Rick: Hey, little buddy. H-h-how you doing in here right now?
Morty: Aw, geez, Rick. What are you doing, man?
Rick: Y-y-you're a good kid, Morty. Y-you're a real l-little c-character, Morty.
Morty: Oh, boy.
Rick: You know, I had a really rocky road today, M-Morty. You're my little friend, aren't you? We had some good times together, huh, M-Morty? We You're a real true hero out in the field. You're a... You're a real trouper, huh, M-M-Morty?
Morty: Have you been drinking, Rick?
Rick: I really appreciate you, Morty.
Morty: O-okay, cool. A-alright, Rick
Morty: No! No! No!
Rick: You little son of a bitch!
Rick: I-I-I’m sorry, Morty. Y-you're a good… You're a good kid, Morty.
Morty: Geez!
Morty: Oh my god!
Morty: W-w-what the hell? What a life.
