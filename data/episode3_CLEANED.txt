Beth: Alive? For your parents?
Jerry: Good one.
Beth: Hey man!
Jerry: You ‘hey man’! This holiday is about humanity.
Jerry: Okay, whatever. All electronic items are going in the stocking. Now.
Summer: Dad, I'm not giving you my phone.
Jerry: Put it in the stocking, Summer, or I'm joining Facebook.
Jerry: More like whoa whoa whoa. What is this? My parents are coming!
Rick: Calm down Jerry, this is Ruben, an old friend.
Ruben: Pearl Harbor.
Beth: Aw, Dad... That is so sweet.
Ruben: Korea.
Leonard: Merry Christmas, son.
Jerry: Oh, hi. Can I help you?
Beth, Summer, and Morty: No.
Jacob: You must be Jerry! That's a fine lookin’ apron. William Sonoma?
Jerry: Wow!
Joyce: After your father's brush with cancer and losing your uncle, we looked at life and wondered how have we spent it? And how do we spend the rest of it? What are we going to be when we die? A list of fears and questions, or a collection of real experiences?
Beth: Holy crap, Joyce. That's amazing.
Leonard: Then Jacob came into our lives. We’re learning to live again.
Jacob: All three of us.
Jerry: ...Cool... Eggnog?
Jacob: Now we are talkin’! This man's got the apron and the eggnog, huh?
Jacob: Merry Christmas, man.
Rick: Morty! A moment of your time?
Rick: He's in bad shape, Morty.
Morty: Aw geez, Rick! What did you do?
Rick: Gee, thanks Morty. What kind of monster do you think I am? I-I'm sittin’ here trying to save the guy's life!  I want you to find Dr. Xenon Bloom. He'll know what's goin’ on.
Morty: Ruben... Minnesota?
Morty: W-What proc—
Beth: Hey Dad, where's Morty?
Rick: He's busy.
Rick : Morty, can you hear me? Head North!
Morty: Rick... Where am I?
Morty : The entrance to what?
Rick: Welcome, Morty.  Welcome...  ...to Anatomy Park!
Rick: It's a little business venture I’ve been cookin’ up on the side with Dr. Bloom.  An amusement park inside a human body. Science isn't cheap, Morty. This should really help put a dent in the overhead.
Morty: Oh my God! This is insane! Spleen Mountain? Bladder Falls? Pirates of the Pancreas?
Rick: You got a problem with that last one, Morty?
Morty: Huh? No, no, I'm just reading them out loud in the order I'm seeing them.
Rick: Okay, alright, if I sounded a little defensive, it's because Pirates of the Pancreas was my baby.
Rick: I-I got a lot of push-back when I pitched it, Morty. I guess I'm still a little defensive. Let's just find Dr. Bloom, alright? I-I'm picking up a distress signal in the liver, Morty.
Rick: Proceed to the liver.
Automated voice: Arriving at ‘Liver’.
Automated voice: Mind the gap.
Morty: It's really scary in here, Rick.
Rick: Liver's under maintenance. Ruben's seen some rough years, Morty. Don't judge. You don't agree to have a theme park built inside you if your life's going great.
Morty: OOOOHHH! Rick, it's a monster!
Poncho: Who are you? Answer me! Where did you come from?
Morty: Mmm! M-M-My-my-my Grandpa Rick sent me!
Dr. Bloom: Poncho! That's quite enough.
Dr. Bloom: Morty, that's Poncho.  This is Roger and Annie.
Dr. Bloom: And I am Dr. Xenon Bloom.
Rick: Hey Bloom, it's Rick. What the hell's goin’ on here?
Dr. Bloom: I don't know why, but the entire security system has shut down. And I'm afraid the exhibits are unlocked.
Morty: Exhibits?
Dr. Bloom: Anatomy Park's greatest attraction, young man, isn't the music or the food or the Pirates of the Pancreas.
Rick: Watch it.
Dr. Bloom: It is first and foremost a living museum of humanity's most noble and ferocious diseases.
Morty: Diseases?!
Poncho: Hey Doc, I have news for ya.  Your living museum is officially a wild safari!
Roger: Hepatitis A! Run!
Jerry: Aha... I'm sorry Jacob, I guess I'm still confused about the precise nature and origin of your relationship with my parents. Are you like a—Are you like their caretaker? Is that what it is?
Joyce: We can go into detail later, son.
Leonard: Now wait, there, there's no point to secrecy. Let's all live and die honestly. Your mother and I have shared forty years of each other, mind, body, and soul.  And when minds and souls are joined for eternity, and when eternity is at the door, it's an invitation to let go of the body, and an opportunity to share and experiment.
Jerry: Dad, please, what are you saying?
Jerry: Speak for yourself! Because it, heheh, it sounds like you're about to say Jacob is your lover.
Leonard: No no no no.  Jacob is your mother's lover.  I watch them. Sometimes from a chair, sometimes from a closet. Almost always dressed as Superman.
Jacob: Jerry, this ham's got to be all you, right? It's in-cred-i-ble.
Poncho: AHHHHHH!
Dr. Bloom: Hepatitis won't follow us into the respiratory system!
Dr. Bloom: So the brain isn't getting enough oxygen. That's why security is offline.
Morty: W-Well, I guess we better check it out.
Roger: If we got up to the bronchial catwalk, we could look for blockage.
Poncho: Don't be a hero, kid.
Dr. Bloom: Whatever you do, don't fire that thing in here! We must save Ruben. This is my life's work.
Annie: Ah!
Morty: Oh! What are those things?!
Dr. Bloom: Tuberculosis, coming in fast!
Dr. Bloom: Get to the digestive tract! He's coughing!
Alexander: Waaaah! Don't let me die!
Rick: Just take a deep breath, Ruben.
Morty: You're not gonna die! What's your name?
Morty: Rick! Ruben's got tuberculosis!
Rick: Okay. Well I can't cure death. This is bad, Morty. You're trapped in a dead man. Listen, if the situation keeps darkening, do yourself a favor—
Rick: —and hop by Pirates of the Pancreas. Obviously I'm biased, but, I think it's great, Morty.
Rick: —please, you gotta treat yourself.
Morty: Geez, what's that horrible smell?
Morty: Forget about the park, Doctor! How do we get out?!
Dr. Bloom: The digestive tract is the evacuation route. Get it? There's an emergency station in the colon with a ray that can enlarge us all.
Morty: Everybody! Get to the colon!
Poncho: Now I'm takin’ orders from a twelve-year-old boy?!
Dr. Bloom: Morty. The scar sacs containing the tuberculosis were sabotaged. This disaster was an inside job. Keep your eyes on Annie. She was written up several times by her manager at the churro stand.
Roger: Intestines are ahead to the left. Then the right. Then left. Et cetera.
Morty: Hey, just so you know, I-I'm actually fourteen. So, you know...
Annie: What?
Morty: Not twelve.
Annie: Okay.
Morty: Because he just said I was twelve.
Annie: Oh. Good for you.
Rick : Oh. Oh, Morty. Strike one.
Roger: It goes on like this for miles...
Dr. Bloom: Wait! I was wrong! I was thinking of a T-rex.
Annie: We’re sitting ducks!
Morty: Doc! Didn't you say the body was filling up with gas?
Dr. Bloom: Yes. Why?
Dr. Bloom: Are you mad?!
Poncho: Hey Gonorrhea! How's this for a burning sensation?
Leonard: Oh, Summer. Sing it! Haha.
Summer: Christmas drums being played by a boy!
Beth: Jerry, come on. This is what you wanted.
Jerry: I get it, Beth. Be careful what you wish for. I'm being punished for taking your iPad.
Beth: What? Jerry, let that stuff go, okay? I'm sorry I was a bitch earlier. Let's just be here.
Ethan: Ugh... Summer!
Ethan: I’ve been texting you for hours. What the hell?!
Summer: I don't have my phone! I'm doing a human holiday!
Ethan: Did you even consider how that might make me feel?
Summer: How you feel? Why is everything always happening to you?!
Ethan: Yeah, do you, Summer?
Summer: I don't know Ethan, do I?
Roger: I should be able to access the backup generator to get the growth ray back online. If it works, we'll be regular-sized in a few minutes. I just hope Ruben's not in a room with white carpets or upholstery.
Poncho: What the hell is that?
Dr. Bloom: The sphincter dam. We built it when Ruben became incontinent, but it was not designed to hold a corpse-load.
Roger: Almost got it. Everybody, move inside the circle!
Morty: Poncho? What is this in your backpack?
Dr. Bloom: That's bubonic plague! What are you doing with that, Poncho?
Poncho: Everybody get back!
Dr. Bloom: Poncho, you son of a bitch! You released the tuberculosis so you could steal from me?
Morty: AHHHHH!!!
Annie: You guys!
Annie: No!
Roger: This is okay! It's okay, just go! Tell my family I love them! They may be hard to find because my wife kept her last name and she made the kids take it too, so, I dunno, you could goo—
Annie: No!
Jacob: Let me ask you something Ethan. Where's the anger coming from, man?
Ethan: From Summer being a total bitch!
Jacob: Where's the anger coming from?
Ethan: Come here right now!
Ethan: I love you so much.
Jerry: Um...
Joyce: You did it again, cubby. Come here.
Jerry: No! Stop! I hate this!
Joyce: Well, Christmas doesn't revolve around what you hate, son.
Jerry: Well then, I hate Christmas! Enjoy being human! You guys are gross and lame.
Animatronic Ruben: My name's Ruben Ridley. You're inside me right now, but by the end of this journey, I'll be inside all of you.
Animatronic Ruben: My story begins in the dot com crash in the early ‘90s.
Rick : Morty, you wanna put it on mute or something? 
Rick: I’m trying to concentrate.
Jerry: Ah, Rick?
Morty: Are you kidding? I’m hoping I can get to both of them, Rick.
Rick : Morty, I’m talkin’ about Ruben's left nipple!
Morty: We need to get to the left nipple!
Annie: If it'll get us out of here.
Dr. Bloom: How about you, Morty? Would you like to ride the Bone Train?
Morty: Why are you doing this bit? We’re gonna die. Let's go.
Jerry: Well, I can see that you're busy... Merry Christmas, Rick.
Dr. Bloom: There's no autopilot. One of us will have to stay here and operate it manually.
Morty: ...Uh, well...
Dr. Bloom: No, you're right. It was a dick move for me to even pause like that. This is all my fault. You go on.
Dr. Bloom: E. coli outbreak. Hurry!
Dr. Bloom: Oh wait, there is an autopilot.  WAAAIT! ...OKAY, NEVER MIND, I WANTED TO SACRIFICE MYSELF ANYWAAAAAYYYY!
Annie: They're chewing through the doors!
Rick: I'm almost there, Morty!
Reporter: Reports are coming in from across the country about what appears to be a giant naked man over the continental United States. We now go to Tom Randolph in New York. Tom?
Tom: Well, his eyes aren't twinkling, and his dimples aren't merry, but I'm standing under a nose like a seventy-mile cherry!
Reporter: Thank you, Tom. Let's go now to Eric McMan in Los Angeles.
Eric: We’ve got feet here on the West Coast, Bill! Giant feet, even relative to the giant man's size! And you know what they say about that!
Reporter: Well, if the old adage is true, one can only wonder what is going down in the Rocky Mountains.
Morty: Oh my god, the track!
Annie: It's Hepatitis A!
Annie: The nipple hole...
Morty: It's beautiful...
Annie: Aw no!
Annie: Whoa! It's Hepatitis C!
Morty: Um... We... Did we have some sort of relationship with him?
Annie: I... think they're just like that? I think they're just good guys.
Morty: Oh. Huh.
Rick: Where's Dr. Bloom?
Morty: Sorry Rick... He's dead...
Rick: Goddamn it, Morty, I ask you to do one thing!
Beth: Jerry doesn't know what he's missing.
Jacob: He'll come around, Beth. Christmas is a special time. It has funny ways of bringing families together.
Beth: I dunno, Jacob. Jerry got an invitation to be alive today, and he rejected it. I don't know if our marriage will—
Summer: It's raining blood!
Jacob: Oh, shit. find Jerry!
Beth: Oh god.
Beth: Jerry!
Reporter : The giant naked sky Santa has exploded. Blood and chunks of viscera are raining down on the country. Everything should be fine.
Summer: Dad, can I have my phone back?
Jacob: This is nice.
Summer: No we didn't, Dad. No we didn't.
Annie: Actually, I studied Dr. Bloom's work. I believe I have the knowledge necessary to create a new, much safer park!
Rick: What about Pirates of the Pancreas...?
Annie: I think it was one of the most underrated attractions.
Rick: Booyah! Hold your breath!
Morty: Hey, wh-wh- What the hell, Rick? What the hell, man? I liked her! I really had somethin’ going there, Rick!
Morty: W-What's wrong with that? That doesn't sound like a problem to me! I dunno!
Rick: C’mon. Let's get some stuffing, I'm starving.
Rick: Oh, unbelievable. We got a bunch of robot computer people sittin’ around with their faces stuffed in computer screens.  Do you realize Christ was born today? Jesus Christ our Savior was born today! A-A-A-Are you people even human? What kind of Christmas is this?
Annie : Hey Rick! Rick, can you hear me?
Rick: Loud and clear, Annie.
Annie: Great! We’re also on with Alejandro, our Chief Imaginarian—
Alejandro: Hey Rick.
Annie: Natalie Jacobs and Chris Desiter from Microscopic Marketing, Zach from Organ Concepts and Jamie from New Media.
Rick: Hey everybody.
All: Hey, hi Rick, how's it goin’. 
Annie: So. Pirates of the Pancreas.
Rick: Yeah, talk to me.
Alejandro: Hey Rick, it's Alejandro speaking. Um, so we asked ourselves internally, we asked ourselves over here, “Okay, what does a pancreas do?”  And the answer was, does it make pirates? No. It makes insulin, you know? So we’re starting with a new—
Ethan: So those guys are inside me, huh? Like, building a park?
Rick: Those guys are inside you building a piece of shit, Ethan! They're inside you building a monument to compromise! Fuck 'em. Fuck those people. Fuck this whole thing, Ethan.
Ethan: ... Cool. And who pays me?
